##Online library list with BB
An extended example of the tutorial from online book Developing Backbone.js Applications - [addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/] (addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals). Running on NodeJS w/ Express framework. I recommend running with nodemon utility. Source changes implementation could be probably more commented, but you'll figure.
If changes after deleting, editing or uploading don't show, hit refresh.

**Improvements over book version**
*   BookImage related functionality (left as exercise in book)
*   Edit button (additional related functionality)
*   Button for uploading book image hidden under div for better presentation (hit the text for upload file dialog)
*   Added some styling and book images to storage
